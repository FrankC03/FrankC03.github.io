      Quantum computing promises faster solutions to complex problems but is hindered by quantum noise. Surface code error correction, a leading approach for handling these errors, becomes computationally intensive for decoding as systems scale, making traditional decoders like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) less efficient.

      This project focuses on developing a neural network-based surface decoder to address the challenges of scalable quantum error correction. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the decoder aims to provide faster and more accurate error correction.
      
      Key responsibilities for this project include:
      - Noise Modeling and Simulation: Designed a quantum noise model covering measurement errors, data qubit idling, syndrome extraction errors, and qubit leakage. 

      - Noise Model Benchmarking: Compare our noise model against other common error models by evaluating the similarity between the error pair correlation matrices, which were derived from repetition code experiments and simulations. 
      
      - Neural Network Design: Based on the designed noise model, implement a neural network-based decoder aimed at improving upon traditional MWPM algorithm. (In Progress)
